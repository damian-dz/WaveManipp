# WaveManipp

**WaveManipp** is intended to be a C++ library for efficient uncompressed audio data manipulation. At this point, it supports WAV files only up to two channels. It does not support audio recording or playback on its own, and there are no plans to implement that. However, in the future, some functionalities should be incorporated into it to facilitate the cooperation with third-party playback/recording libraries.

## Compiling from Source

Probably the easiest way to compile WaveManipp from source on Windows is by using [premake5](https://github.com/premake/premake-core) in tandem with Microsoft Visual Studio. Assuming that the premake5 path is in your environment variables and you are inside the folder where premake5.lua resides, you can type in Command Prompt:

```
premake5 vs2019
```

This should generate a solution and a project, both of which will be called WaveManipp. You should see eight configurations available -- DynDebug, DynRelease, StaDebug, StaRelease -- for both the Win32 and x64 platforms. The Dyn- prefix stands for dynamic, and the Sta- prefix stands for static. If you want to build all of the configurations/platforms at once, go to Build -> Batch Build -> Select All, and then Build.

Building from source has been tested with the MSVC compiler, version 19.22.27905, as well as the GCC g++, version 5.1.0 (using the options `-pedantic-errors -std=c++17 -Wall`).

## Introduction

In order to use the library classes and methods in our code, we have to include the necessary headers. This can be done by including the `WaveManipp.h` header file somewhere at the top of the header/source file.

```c++
#include <WaveManipp.h>
```

The easiest way to load an uncompressed audio file into memory is to do it from within the constructor by providing the path to the file (filename). All of the **WaveManipp** classes reside in the `wm` namespace.

```c++
wm::Wave wave("D:/AudioSamples/test.wav");
```

Alternatively, one can load a file by calling the empty constructor first and then using `open()`.

```c++
wm::Wave wave;
wave.open("D:/AudioSamples/test.wav");
```

The overloaded `std::ostream` operator lets us display the basic information about the opened file fairly easily.

```c++
std::cout << wave << std::endl;
```

The line above should ouput something along the lines of:

```
ChunkID: RIFF
ChunkSize: 351966
Format: WAVE
----------
Subchunk1ID: fmt
Subchunk1Size: 16
AudioFormat: 1
NumChannels: 2
SampleRate: 44100
ByteRate: 176400
BlockAlign: 4
BitsPerSample: 16
----------
Subchunk2ID: data
Subchunk2Size: 351812
```

For example, we can now generate a sine wave and append it to the existing `Wave` object.

```c++
auto sineWave = wm::Wave::generateSine(220.f, 0.f, 44100, 44100);
wave.append(sineWave);
```

We should be able to see the updated header data.

```c++
std::cout << wave << std::endl;
```

```
ChunkID: RIFF
ChunkSize: 528248
Format: WAVE
----------
Subchunk1ID: fmt
Subchunk1Size: 16
AudioFormat: 1
NumChannels: 2
SampleRate: 44100
ByteRate: 176400
BlockAlign: 4
BitsPerSample: 16
----------
Subchunk2ID: data
Subchunk2Size: 528212
```

We can easily save the result by calling the `save()` method with a filename.

```c++
wave.save("result.wav");
```

## The `Wave` Class

The `Wave` class represents an audio file stored in memory. All audio data within a `Wave` object is stored using single-precision floating-point values. While in many cases this means using more memory than necessary, it is much more convenient for effective audio data manipulation. Otherwise, every time we called a method to perform some operation on the data, each sample would have to be converted to a floating-point value first and then converted back to whatever its original format was.

### Supported Formats

So far, **WaveManipp** supports uncompressed RIFF/RIFX mono and stereo WAV files. The supported audio sample bit depths are 8, 16, 24, and 32. Support for more channels may be added in the future.

## The `WaveBuilder` Class

Even though internally **WaveManipp** uses the C functions `std::malloc`, `std::calloc`, and `std::realloc` for memory allocation and reallocation, it may still be suboptimal when merging a large number of `Wave` objects. The better solution is to use the `WaveBuilder` class, which stores pointers to the actual `Wave` objects. When using this class, it is crucial to remember that the consituent objects be not destroyed before creating the final `Wave` object using the `toWave()` method. When used properly, the `Wave` object is created only once, so there is no need for repeated memory reallocation.

## The `WaveMixer` Class

This class emulates a "mixing board" by making it possible to combine different `Wave` objects in a non-sequential way. Just as the `WaveBuilder` class, it stores only pointers to existing `Wave` objects, so none of them should go out of scope (if created on the stack) or be explicitly destroyed (if created on the heap) before `toWave()` is called.

Conceptually, a `WaveMixer` object is composed of *audio tracks*, wheareas tracks are made up of "audio chunks." They are actually `Wave` objects themselves, or rather pointers to the actual objects. The default empty constructor creates a `WaveMixer` object with no tracks. Therefore, in order to start adding audio chunks, we need to call the `addTrack()` method first:

```c++
wm::WaveMixer waveMixer;
waveMixer.addTrack();
```
Now we can insert an audio chunk by providing the track index as well as a `Wave` object:

```c++
waveMixer.insertChunk(0, 10000, sineWave);
```
